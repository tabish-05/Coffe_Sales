Project Status Update: Analysis of Coffee Shop Sales

Hello everyone! I’m thrilled to announce that I’ve finished an intriguing project involving the analysis of Coffee Shop Sales with Microsoft Excel. This one focused on analyzing the figures, revealing trends, and producing something significant.

Here’s a brief overview of what I focused on:

Initially, I concentrated on tidying and structuring the data. Initially, it was disorganized, but organizing it was essential for the subsequent analysis. After the data was prepared, I began addressing several important questions.

I examined the overall revenue for every month to grasp the business's high and low activity times. It was intriguing to observe how sales varied over time. I then visited the store locations to compare their performance and determine which branches attracted the most customers and generated the highest revenue.

Subsequently, I explored the products—analyzing the top sellers regarding both units sold and income generated. This showed what customers enjoyed the most and emphasized the menu's standout items. I additionally investigated sales by category and type, which revealed some intriguing insights into overall customer preferences.

Additionally, I computed the average price per order to gain a clearer insight into spending patterns and overall effectiveness. Ultimately, I consolidated everything into a dashboard. It’s tidy, visually appealing, and crafted to address these inquiries quickly.

This project enabled me to enhance my abilities in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, and emphasized the effectiveness of Excel when applied in innovative ways.
